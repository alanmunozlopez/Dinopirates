# Enemies and Combat Documentation

This document explains the enemy AI system and the rhythm-based "Dance Scene" combat system.

## 👾 Enemy AI & Global Data

Enemies (like the `Brocorat`) inherit from the base `Enemy` class and are influenced by global stats stored in `PlayerData`.

### 1. Global Enemy Data (`PlayerData.EnemiesData`)
Located in `source/assets/data/PlayerDataTables.lua`, these values scale the difficulty of the game:
- **`powerLevel`**: (1-20) Increases enemy detection range and determines difficulty profiles in the Dance Scene.
- **`sightRadius`**: (Base 50) The distance at which an enemy can detect the player.
- **`isEvolved`**: A boolean flag indicating if enemies have reached a more dangerous state.

### 2. Detection & Movement
- **`search(player)`**: Checks if the player is within `sightRadius`. If detected, triggers `blindSearch`.
- **`blindSearch(player)`**: Moves the enemy directly toward the player's current X/Y.
- **`linealSearch(player)`**: An alternative AI where enemies only move if the player is aligned on the same X or Y axis.
- **Speed Scaling**: `updateMoveSpeed()` adjusts enemy speed based on the player's battery and darkness. They slow down significantly when the player is in darkness with low battery.
- **Movement Tokens**: Like CrewMembers, enemies use `movementFrames` to throttle their updates for performance.

### 3. Special Behaviors
- **Sonar**: `sonar()` makes enemies "shine" when the player is nearby, focused, and in darkness, providing visual feedback of their presence.
- **Blinding**: `blind(frames)` temporarily stops enemy movement when hit by a light flash.
- **Edible Props**: Some enemies can "eat" certain `PropItem` objects if their `powerLevel` is high enough.

## 💃 Dance Scene (Combat System)

When a player collides with an enemy, the game transitions to the `DanceScene`.

### 1. The Transition
In `collisions.lua`, hitting an `Enemy` calls `self:fight()`, which:
- Increments `PlayerData.amountDances`.
- Stores info about the encounter in `PlayerData.lastEnemyTouched` (ID, Type, Position).
- Transitions the scene to `DanceScene`.

### 2. Difficulty Profiles
The `DanceScene` selects a pattern profile based on `PlayerData.EnemiesData.powerLevel`:
- **Basic** (1-5): Slow BPM (16), 4 buttons, mostly arrows.
- **Evolve** (6-12): Faster BPM (24), 6 buttons, mixed input.
- **Badass** (13-19): Very fast BPM (28), 8 buttons, tough patterns.
- **Boss** (20): Max speed BPM (32), 12 buttons, high button spam.

### 3. Rhythm Mechanics
- **ButtonPress**: Sprites move from right to left across the screen.
- **HitZone**: The area on the left where the player must press the corresponding button.
- **Balance Bar**: A "tug-of-war" indicator.
    - **Correct Press**: Moves balance toward the **Win** side. `A/B` buttons deal damage to enemy HP; **Arrows** increase evade power/accuracy.
    - **Wrong Press/Miss**: Moves balance toward the **Lose** side.
- **Animations**: `EnemyRatDance` and `PlayerDance` change animations based on inputs and hits.

### 4. Outcomes
- **Win**: The enemy is removed from the world via `findAndKillEnemyById`, player gains 60 calories, and transitions back to the maze.
- **Lose**: Transitions to the `TitleScene` (Game Over).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `determineDifficultyUpgrade()` function in `DanceScene` uses a weighted calculation of Player **Sanity**, **Power**, and **Calories** to decide if an encounter should be harder than the base level.
